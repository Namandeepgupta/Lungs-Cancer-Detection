# Lung Cancer Detection

This project implements a machine learning pipeline for detecting lung cancer. Using medical datasets, the project applies preprocessing, feature engineering, and classification models to predict the presence of lung cancer with high accuracy.

## Project Features
- **Data Preprocessing**
  - Handling missing data
  - Normalization and scaling
  - Feature selection and extraction
- **Machine Learning Models**
  - Logistic Regression
  - Decision Trees
  - Random Forests
  - Support Vector Machines (SVM)
  - Neural Networks (optional for advanced versions)
- **Evaluation Metrics**
  - Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score
  - Confusion Matrix
  - ROC-AUC Curve
- **Visualization**
  - Data distribution plots
  - Model performance metrics
- **Future Enhancements**
  - Implementing deep learning for image-based detection
  - Integration with a web application for predictions

## Dataset
- **Source**: Publicly available lung cancer datasets (e.g., UCI ML Repository, Kaggle).
- **Format**: CSV or medical imaging data (e.g., DICOM, PNG).
- **Data Description**:
  - Features: Age, smoking history, genetic predisposition, tumor size, etc.
  - Target: Binary classification (Cancerous/Non-Cancerous).

## How to Run the Project
### Prerequisites
- Python 3.x
- Libraries: NumPy, Pandas, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn, TensorFlow (optional)

### Steps
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Namandeepgupt/Lungs-Cancer-Detection.git
   cd Lungs-Cancer-Detection
2. Install the required dependencies:
   pip install -r requirements.txt
3. Run the script:
   python lung_cancer_detection.py
4. View the results:
   Model performance metrics will be printed in the console.
   Plots will be saved in the plots/ directory.
